## v1.3 Requirements

Requirements for milestone v1.3 Image Auto-Play.

### Image Auto-Play

- [ ] **IMGAP-02**: Coach can tap again to stop the slideshow
- [ ] **IMGAP-03**: Play/pause icon overlay is visible on the image indicating current state
- [ ] **IMGAP-04**: Manual swipe stops auto-play if active
- [ ] **IMGAP-05**: Auto-play is only available for exercises with multiple Lumio images (single-image exercises are unaffected)

## Future Requirements

None planned.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Configurable slideshow speed | 3 sec fixed is sufficient for coaching context |
| Auto-play on main app (non-live) | Feature is tablet live-only |
| Video/animation support in Lumio cards | Out of scope, images only |
