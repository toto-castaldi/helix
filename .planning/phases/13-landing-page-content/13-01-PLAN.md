  <name>Task 1: Build complete bilingual landing page with hero, features, CTA, and language toggle</name>
  <files>src/landing/main.ts, src/landing/style.css, landing.html</files>
  <action>
Replace the stub content in `src/landing/main.ts` with the complete landing page. This is vanilla JS (no React) — build all HTML as template literals injected into `#app`.

**I18N System:**
Create a translations object with `it` and `en` keys. All user-visible strings must be in both languages. Detect browser language on first load:
- Check `localStorage.getItem('helix-lang')` first (returning visitor)
- If not set, check `navigator.language` — if starts with "it", use "it"; if starts with "en", use "en"
- Fallback: "it" (Italian default per user decision)
- Persist choice to `localStorage.setItem('helix-lang', lang)`

Create a `render(lang)` function that rebuilds `#app` innerHTML with all translated content, and also updates `document.documentElement.lang` attribute.

**Language Toggle:**
Place a small toggle in the top-right corner of the page, fixed position. Use a simple pill/capsule design with "IT" and "EN" labels — the active language is highlighted with the Helix amber color. Clicking the inactive language switches and re-renders. Keep it subtle but accessible — fits the warm professional design without a navbar.

**Hero Section:**
- Helix logo (`/logo.svg`) prominently centered, ~120px on mobile, ~160px on desktop
- "Helix" title text with the existing gradient (amber → coral → violet) using CSS custom properties
- Tagline underneath:
  - IT: "Il tuo assistente AI per il coaching fitness"
  - EN: "Your AI-powered fitness coaching assistant"
- Tagline should be in a softer gray color, professional font size
- Two CTA buttons below tagline:
  - Primary (filled, amber/coral gradient): "Coach App" → links to `https://coach.helix.toto-castaldi.com`
  - Secondary (outlined): "Live Tablet" → links to `https://live.helix.toto-castaldi.com`
- Add a subtle decorative element — a soft radial gradient or glow behind the logo using brand colors at low opacity

**Features Section:**
- Section title: IT "Cosa offre Helix" / EN "What Helix offers"
- 3-4 icon cards in a responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3-4 col desktop)
- Each card: icon (use emoji or simple SVG inline), title, 1-2 line description
- Pick 3-4 features that best represent Helix's value. Suggestions:

  1. **AI Training Plans** (highlight AI prominently)
     - Icon: brain/sparkle emoji or SVG
     - IT: "Pianificazione AI" / "Genera piani di allenamento personalizzati con l'intelligenza artificiale"
     - EN: "AI Planning" / "Generate personalized training plans with artificial intelligence"

  2. **Client Management**
     - Icon: users emoji or SVG
     - IT: "Gestione Clienti" / "Profili completi con anamnesi, obiettivi e storico sessioni"
     - EN: "Client Management" / "Complete profiles with health history, goals, and session records"

  3. **Live Coaching**
     - Icon: tablet emoji or SVG
     - IT: "Coaching Live" / "Guida gli allenamenti in tempo reale dal tablet in palestra"
     - EN: "Live Coaching" / "Guide workouts in real-time from your tablet at the gym"

  4. **Exercise Library**
     - Icon: book/dumbbell emoji or SVG
     - IT: "Libreria Esercizi" / "Catalogo esercizi con immagini e schede Lumio personalizzabili"
     - EN: "Exercise Library" / "Exercise catalog with images and customizable Lumio cards"

- Cards should have a subtle border or shadow, rounded corners, and a light background. Use brand colors sparingly as accents (e.g., icon color or top border).

**Bottom CTA Section:**
- Repeat CTA buttons (same as hero) after the features section
- Add a brief motivational line above: IT "Pronto a trasformare il tuo coaching?" / EN "Ready to transform your coaching?"
- Generous vertical padding to give breathing room

**Style Approach (style.css):**
Keep existing `:root` variables and body styles. Add:
- Smooth scroll behavior (`scroll-behavior: smooth`)
- Feature card styles with hover transitions (subtle scale or shadow lift)
- Gradient button styles using CSS custom properties
- Responsive utilities beyond Tailwind defaults if needed
- A subtle animated gradient background or soft pattern for the hero area (very light, not distracting)
- Typography: use `tracking-tight` on headings for professional feel

**landing.html:**
- Update the `lang` attribute to be dynamic-ready (start with "it" since that's the fallback default)
- Ensure meta description covers both languages or is generic enough

**IMPORTANT constraints (from user decisions):**
- Warm & approachable mood — NO dark/techy/cold aesthetics
- NO navbar, NO footer, NO "how it works" section
- Single scroll, minimal structure: Hero + Features + CTA only
- Professional but friendly tone throughout
- Vanilla JS only — no React, no framework imports
