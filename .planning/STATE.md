## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Partial index for is_group | Space efficiency - most exercises not group, only index true values |
| 01-01 | NOT NULL DEFAULT false | Backward compatibility - existing rows get false automatically |
| 02-01 | Follow existing patterns exactly | No architectural changes needed, code consistency |
| 02-01 | is_group defaults to false in inserts | Backward compatibility with existing code paths |
| 03-01 | Follow existing Saltato toggle pattern | UI consistency - Di gruppo toggle mirrors Saltato structure |
| 03-01 | Badge with Users icon | Visual indicator matches toggle icon for clear association |
| 03-01 | Summary count only when > 0 | Avoid visual clutter when no group exercises |
| 04-01 | SECURITY INVOKER for RPC functions | Respects RLS policies, user context preserved |
| 04-02 | Underscore prefix for unused destructured | TypeScript pattern to suppress unused variable errors |
| 04-03 | Toast duration 4 seconds | Enough time to react, not too long |
| 04-03 | Undo uses individual DB updates | Acceptable for rare undo path, not atomic RPC |
| 04-03 | Participants sorted by status | Pending first for visibility |
