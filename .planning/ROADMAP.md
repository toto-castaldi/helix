### v1.2 Lumio Exercise Images (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Show the first Lumio card image directly in the exercise card of the live tablet carousel, giving coaches a visual reference during sessions.

#### Phase 10: Lumio Image in ExerciseCard

**Goal**: Coach sees the first Lumio card image in the exercise carousel card on the live tablet
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (v1.1 complete)
**Requirements**: IMG-01, IMG-02, IMG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On the live tablet, an exercise with a Lumio card that has images shows the first image in its carousel card
  2. The image fits within the card without breaking the existing layout (exercise name, parameters, notes all remain visible and properly positioned)
  3. An exercise without a Lumio card, or with a Lumio card that has no images, displays exactly as it does today (no empty space, no placeholder, no layout shift)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
